## ✅ COMPLETED: Frontend Implementation

### Panel Layout - ✅ DONE
Created React component with three evenly divided vertical panels:

1. **Left Panel**: Scrollable content feed
2. **Middle Panel**: Trivia questions (one at a time with queue system)
3. **Right Panel**: Voice box icon (placeholder for future feature)

### React Components - ✅ ALL CREATED

#### 1. Content Cards (Left Panel)
- `MovieCard.js` - Display movie title, embedded YouTube player, description
- `NewsCard.js` - Display article title, 3-sentence description, "Read more" link
- `MusicCard.js` - Display 3 songs in playlist format (album art, name, artist, Spotify play button)
- `FoodCard.js` - Display restaurant name, photo, description, price level, website link
- `AttractionCard.js` - Display attraction name, photo, cultural significance description

#### 2. Trivia System (Middle Panel)
- `TriviaQuestion.js` - Display single question with 4 multiple-choice options
- **Queue Logic**:
  - Wrong answers → move question to end of queue
  - Only when all 25 questions answered correctly → show completion message
- Track progress: "Question X of 25"

#### 3. Voice Box (Right Panel) - ✅ DONE
- Simple button with voice icon
- Non-functional placeholder for now

2. `frontend/src/components/TriviaPanel.js` - Queue-based trivia system
3. `frontend/src/components/VoiceBoxPlaceholder.js` - Voice icon placeholder
4. `frontend/src/components/cards/MovieCard.js` - Movie trailer cards

8. `frontend/src/components/cards/AttractionCard.js` - Tourist attraction cards
9. `frontend/src/CulturalSnapshotPage.js` - Entry page with country input

### All Implementation Steps Complete!

### Step 1: Create Base Layout Component
```jsx
// components/CulturalSnapshot.js
const CulturalSnapshot = () => {
  return (
    <Container>
      <LeftPanel>{/* Content Cards */}</LeftPanel>
      <MiddlePanel>{/* Trivia Questions */}</MiddlePanel>
      <RightPanel>{/* Voice Icon */}</RightPanel>
    </Container>
  );
};
```

### Step 2: Integrate with Backend
```jsx
const loadContentFeed = async (country, interests) => {
  const response = await axios.post('/api/content-feed', {
    country,
    interests
  });
  return response.data.cards;
};

const loadTrivia = async (country, contentCards) => {
  const response = await axios.post('/api/trivia', {
    country,
    content_cards: contentCards
  });
  return response.data.questions;
};
```

### Step 3: Implement Trivia Queue System
```jsx
const [questionQueue, setQuestionQueue] = useState([]);
const [currentQuestionIndex, setCurrentQuestionIndex] = useState(0);

const handleAnswerSubmit = (selectedAnswer) => {
  if (selectedAnswer !== currentQuestion.correct_answer) {
    // Wrong answer: move to end of queue
    setQuestionQueue([...questionQueue.slice(1), questionQueue[0]]);
  } else {
    // Correct answer: move to next question
    setCurrentQuestionIndex(currentQuestionIndex + 1);
  }
  
  if (questionQueue.length === 1) {
    // All questions answered correctly
    setCompleted(true);
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Style with Styled Components
- Three-panel layout with flexbox/grid
- Scrollable left panel for cards
- Centered trivia panel
- Consistent card styling
- Responsive design

## 🔧 Backend Integration Requirements

### Need to Complete Integrations

#### 1. TMDB Integration (`backend/integrations/tmdb.py`)
**Purpose**: Get movie information and YouTube trailer links

**Methods Needed**:
- `get_popular_movies(country)` - Returns popular movies in country
- `get_movie_trailer(movie_id)` - Returns YouTube trailer link

#### 2. Enhance Existing Integrations
- **NewsAPI**: Already exists, need to format for cards
- **Spotify**: Already exists, need playlist format
- **TripAdvisor**: Already exists, need restaurant/attraction details

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Create React components** for the three-panel layout
2. **Implement card components** (Movie, News, Music, Food, Attraction)
3. **Build trivia queue system** with answer handling
4. **Add styling** for the cultural snapshot interface
5. **Test the flow**: content generation → card display → trivia generation → quiz completion

---

## 📝 API Usage Example

### Full Flow

```javascript
// 1. User enters country and interests
const country = "Japan";
const interests = ["movies", "news", "music"];

// 2. Generate content feed
const contentResponse = await axios.post('http://localhost:5001/api/content-feed', {
  country,
  interests
});

const cards = contentResponse.data.cards; // Minimum 7 cards

// 3. Generate trivia based on content
const triviaResponse = await axios.post('http://localhost:5001/api/trivia', {
  country,
  content_cards: cards
});

const questions = triviaResponse.data.questions; // 25 questions

// 4. Display cards and start trivia quiz
```
